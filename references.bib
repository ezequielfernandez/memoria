ABSTRACT = {In adult intensive care, brain hypothermia therapy (BHT) was reported to be effective in neuroprotection after resuscitation and cardiac arrest. By contrast, in neonatal intensive care, the pathophysiology of brain damage caused by hypoxic–ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) is attributed to circulatory disturbances resulting from ischemia/reperfusion, for which neonatal brain cryotherapy is used. The International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation, 2010, recommends cerebral cryotherapy for HIE associated with severe neonatal pseudoparenchyma death. The usefulness of BHT for neuroprotection in infants and children, especially in pediatric acute encephalopathy, is expected. Theoretically, BHT could be useful in basic medical science and animal experiments. However, there are limitations in clinical planning for treating pediatric acute encephalopathy. No international collaborative study has been conducted, and no clinical evidence exists for neuroprotection using BHT. In this review, we will discuss the pathogenesis of neuronal damage in hypoxic and hypoperfused brains; the history of BHT, its effects, and mechanisms of action; the success of BHT; cooling and monitoring methods of BHT; adverse reactions to BHT; literature on BHT. We will review the latest literature on targeted temperature management, which is used for maintaining and controlling body temperature in adults in intensive care. Finally, we will discuss the development of BHT and targeted temperature management as treatments for pediatric acute encephalopathy.},

ABSTRACT={<p>Hypothermia is a life-threatening condition where the temperature of the body drops below 35°C and is a key source of concern in Intensive Care Units (ICUs). Early identification can help to nudge clinical management to initiate early interventions. Despite its importance, very few studies have focused on the early prediction of hypothermia. In this study, we aim to monitor and predict Hypothermia (30 min-4 h) ahead of its onset using machine learning (ML) models developed on physiological vitals and to prospectively validate the best performing model in the pediatric ICU. We developed and evaluated ML algorithms for the early prediction of hypothermia in a pediatric ICU. Sepsis advanced forecasting engine ICU Database (SafeICU) data resource is an in-house ICU source of data built in the Pediatric ICU at the All-India Institute of Medical Science (AIIMS), New Delhi. Each time-stamp at 1-min resolution was labeled for the presence of hypothermia to construct a retrospective cohort of pediatric patients in the SafeICU data resource. The training set consisted of windows of the length of 4.2 h with a lead time of 30 min-4 h from the onset of hypothermia. A set of 3,835 hand-engineered time-series features were calculated to capture physiological features from the time series. Features selection using the Boruta algorithm was performed to select the most important predictors of hypothermia. A battery of models such as gradient boosting machine, random forest, AdaBoost, and support vector machine (SVM) was evaluated utilizing five-fold test sets. The best-performing model was prospectively validated. A total of 148 patients with 193 ICU stays were eligible for the model development cohort. Of 3,939 features, 726 were statistically significant in the Boruta analysis for the prediction of Hypothermia. The gradient boosting model performed best with an Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUROC) of 85% (SD = 1.6) and a precision of 59.2% (SD = 8.8) for a 30-min lead time before the onset of Hypothermia onset. As expected, the model showed a decline in model performance at higher lead times, such as AUROC of 77.2% (SD = 2.3) and precision of 41.34% (SD = 4.8) for 4 h ahead of Hypothermia onset. Our GBM(gradient boosting machine) model produced equal and superior results for the prospective validation, where an AUROC of 79.8% and a precision of 53% for a 30-min lead time before the onset of Hypothermia whereas an AUROC of 69.6% and a precision of 38.52% for a (30 min-4 h) lead time prospective validation of Hypothermia. Therefore, this work establishes a pipeline termed <italic>ThermoGnose</italic> for predicting hypothermia, a major complication in pediatric ICUs.</p>}}

ABSTRACT = {Background: Inadvertent intraoperative hypothermia is a common complication that affects patient comfort and morbidity. As the development of hypothermia is a complex phenomenon, predicting it using machine learning (ML) algorithms may be superior to logistic regression. Methods: We performed a single-center retrospective study and assembled a feature set comprised of 71 variables. The primary outcome was hypothermia burden, defined as the area under the intraoperative temperature curve below 37 °C over time. We built seven prediction models (logistic regression, extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), random forest (RF), multi-layer perceptron neural network (MLP), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), k-nearest neighbor (KNN), and Gaussian naïve Bayes (GNB)) to predict whether patients would not develop hypothermia or would develop mild, moderate, or severe hypothermia. For each model, we assessed discrimination (F1 score, area under the receiver operating curve, precision, recall) and calibration (calibration-in-the-large, calibration intercept, calibration slope). Results: We included data from 87,116 anesthesia cases. Predicting the hypothermia burden group using logistic regression yielded a weighted F1 score of 0.397. Ranked from highest to lowest weighted F1 score, the ML algorithms performed as follows: XGBoost (0.44), RF (0.418), LDA (0.406), LDA (0.4), KNN (0.362), and GNB (0.32). Conclusions: ML is suitable for predicting intraoperative hypothermia and could be applied in clinical practice.},

    abstract = { A real-time hypothermia and hyperthermia monitoring system with a simple body sensor based on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is presented. The sensor is produced with 3D-printed thermochromic material. Due to the color change feature of thermochromic materials with temperature, 3D-printed thermochromic Polylactic Acid (PLA) material was used to monitor temperature changes visually. In this paper, we have used the transfer learning technique and fine-tuned the AlexNet CNN. Thirty images for each temperature class between 28–44°C and 510 image data were used in the algorithm. We used 80\% and 20\% of the data for training and validation. We achieved 96.1\% accuracy of validation with a fine-tuned AlexNet CNN. The material’s characteristics suggest that it could be employed in delicate temperature sensing and monitoring applications, particularly for hypothermia and hyperthermia. }

abstract = {Frost can cause irreversible damage to plant tissue and can significantly reduce yields and quality. A thorough understanding of the freezing dynamics is crucial to developing strategies for frost protection and the prevention of freezing damage. This study investigated artificial intelligence machine learning (ML) models to capture the thermodynamic patterns of freezing based on infrared thermography (IRT) imagery, which would help to automate the image analysis process in real-time or post frost events. A small-scale dataset of IRT images was collected to capture the freezing process from sample droplets containing ice-nucleating bacterium. We performed several ML experiments on the data to detect the transitions in temperatures from the images. We evaluated five popular ML models, namely support vector machines, random forest (RF), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), multi-layer perceptron, and convolutional neural networks. We analysed the dataset to classify adjacent temperature transitions. The results show that ML models can consistently capture the thermodynamics of frost events, i.e., ice-nucleation and freezing points on typical freezing curves. Amongst the ML models, RF and XGBoost achieved the best results, both with an average accuracy of 87–88% in classifying the temperatures. With 0.25 °C temperature transitions, RF model identified the ice nucleation and freezing points at around −2.25 °C to −2.75 °C and −4.25 °C to −4.75 °C, respectively. RF and XGBoost took about 7.3 ms and 5.5 ms time per image respectively, which indicates that these models can be used in real-time applications. Our study shows that ML models using IRT imagery can be used as an automatic real-time tool to accurately detect the critical temperatures for frost formation.}

abstract="Background: Hypoxia is an important risk factor and indicator for the declining health of inpatients. Predicting future hypoxic events using machine learning is a prospective area of study to facilitate time-critical interventions to counter patient health deterioration. Objective: This systematic review aims to summarize and compare previous efforts to predict hypoxic events in the hospital setting using machine learning with respect to their methodology, predictive performance, and assessed population. Methods: A systematic literature search was performed using Web of Science, Ovid with Embase and MEDLINE, and Google Scholar. Studies that investigated hypoxia or hypoxemia of hospitalized patients using machine learning models were considered. Risk of bias was assessed using the Prediction Model Risk of Bias Assessment Tool. Results: After screening, a total of 12 papers were eligible for analysis, from which 32 models were extracted. The included studies showed a variety of population, methodology, and outcome definition. Comparability was further limited due to unclear or high risk of bias for most studies (10/12, 83{\%}). The overall predictive performance ranged from moderate to high. Based on classification metrics, deep learning models performed similar to or outperformed conventional machine learning models within the same studies. Models using only prior peripheral oxygen saturation as a clinical variable showed better performance than models based on multiple variables, with most of these studies (2/3, 67{\%}) using a long short-term memory algorithm. Conclusions: Machine learning models provide the potential to accurately predict the occurrence of hypoxic events based on retrospective data. The heterogeneity of the studies and limited generalizability of their results highlight the need for further validation studies to assess their predictive performance.

abstract = {Gas turbine transient simulation is an important tool in analysing engine performance during changes in operating conditions. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the development of gas turbine transient simulation, heat transfer effect on transient performance and transient simulation platforms over the past 70 years. The paper highlights the various methods used for gas turbine overall transient simulation, including white box approach, black box approach and numerical approach, and the development of models for heat transfer effects, including heat soakage, tip clearance, and component characteristic changes. Besides, the development of gas turbine transient simulation platforms has been included. Challenges that need to be addressed to achieve more accurate simulations are identified. For white and black box approaches, complex engine dynamics phenomena and heat transfer effects urge the development of methodologies. For the numerical approach, the high computational and geometry demand for the full-size gas turbine transient model slows the CFD application in gas turbine overall transient simulation. For heat transfer effect simulation, the increasing complexity of engine structures and cooling techniques urges the development of a more realistic heat soakage model. The paper suggests that the white box approach can benefit from a method that accurately models several thermal dynamics. The black box methodologies should consider the heat transfer effect during the modelling and training. And more attention should be paid to the full-size gas turbine transient model development. Additionally, the paper recommends the development of a more complete heat transfer model that includes axial clearance effects, detailed combustor heat transfer models, and advanced component maps.}
